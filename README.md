# About this project

&emsp;This is a small game that implements movement mechanics from the Source engine, specifically the CS:GO KZ (Kreedz) movement. The implementation is based on the details found at [CHONG Jiang Wei's Half-Life Physics Reference](https://www.jwchong.com/hl/)

&emsp;The goal of the game is to test the movement mechanics I have implemented by reaching the end of the map, where you need to use basic surf and bunny hop skills to "eat" a burger.
